So I want to start with
a very simple question. These are three products
and brands that most of you in the audience are
probably quite familiar with. So on the left, we
have Walt Disneyorld, the self described place
where dreams come true. In the middle, we
have honey nut Cheos, the delicious breakfast cereal, which may or may not
carry your cholesterol. And on the right, we have scrubbing bubbles,
the bathroom cleaner. So if you had to guess, which of these three
products do you think gets the most
word of mouth? Is it Disney World, Cheerios or Scrubbing Bubbles? And I'm actually going to
ask everybody to vote. So you want to take
a first guess? Scrubb Scrubbing Bubbles. How many people want
for scrubbing bubbles? Okay? Good. Somebody else want
to take a different vote? Yeah. D. Disney World. How many people want to
go with Disney? Okay. Good. Anybody else?
That's it. Okay. Cheers. Okay, you'll say cheers. You'll be the brave
soul. Okay, good. Cheers. Cheerios. Go ahead. We got a couple of
people for Cheerios. Alright. So I want to point
out two things in this. First, I don't think we
know the answer, right? So we went around about I'd say about 45% of the folks were
for scrubbing bubbles, about 45% were for Disneyord. So we were pretty evenly
split among those two. So we're not really
sure of the answer. But second, if we
did have to guess, so how many people
guessed Disney World?
